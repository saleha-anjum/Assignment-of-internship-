Lists:

Lists in Python are versatile data structures that allow storing and manipulating sequences of items. Python's Official Documentation provides comprehensive coverage of list operations such as appending, extending, slicing, and list comprehensions. GeeksforGeeks offers additional insights and practical examples, highlighting use cases for list manipulation in various programming scenarios.

# Example of list operations
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Append and extend operations
my_list.append(6)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

my_list.extend([7, 8, 9])
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# List comprehensions
squared = [x ** 2 for x in my_list]
print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]


Strings:

Strings are fundamental in Python, and their manipulation is extensively covered in the Python Official Documentation. It includes methods for string formatting, splitting, joining, and handling Unicode strings. Real Python offers practical insights into string manipulation, demonstrating their application in real-world programming tasks.


# Example of string methods
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Split and join operations
split_string = my_string.split(", ")
print(split_string)  # Output: ['Hello', 'World!']

joined_string = "-".join(split_string)
print(joined_string)  # Output: Hello-World!

# String formatting
name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(formatted_string)  # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.



Functions:

Functions are essential for modularizing code in Python. The Python Official Documentation covers function definitions, parameters, return statements, and more. Programiz offers practical coding exercises and examples, including recursion and lambda functions.


# Example of defining functions
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(add_numbers(3, 5))  # Output: 8

# Lambda function
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
print(multiply(2, 3))  # Output: 6
